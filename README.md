## App Bodega

This is a project I have done for Botic√°rio's Programa Desenvolve to study mobile first front-end design. It is a landing page for a fictional app-building company called App Bodega. It was built using static HTML 5.0 and CSS 3.0. It has three distinct layouts: Mobile, Tablet and Desktop.
