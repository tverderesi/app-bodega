# App Bodega

This is a project I have done for [BoticÃ¡rio's Programa Desenvolve](https://desenvolve.grupoboticario.com.br/) to study mobile-first front-end design. It is a landing page for a fictional app-building company called App Bodega. The goal of this project was to practice creating responsive layouts for different devices.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- Static HTML 5.0: The structure and content of the page were created using HTML 5.0 markup language.
- CSS 3.0: Cascading Style Sheets were used to style and customize the appearance of the page.
- Mobile-First Design: The design approach followed a mobile-first strategy, ensuring a seamless experience on smaller devices.

## Layouts

The landing page includes three distinct layouts:

1. Mobile Layout: Optimized for mobile devices with smaller screens, providing a user-friendly experience on smartphones.
2. Tablet Layout: Designed to adapt to tablet-sized screens, ensuring the content remains accessible and visually appealing.
3. Desktop Layout: Tailored for larger desktop screens, taking advantage of the additional space to showcase the content.

## Usage

To view the App Bodega landing page, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Explore the different layouts by resizing the browser window or testing on various devices.

Feel free to explore the responsive design and analyze how the page adapts to different screen sizes.
